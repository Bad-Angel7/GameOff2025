I didn't have time to make a tutorial so that's here for now

CONTROLS:
1 2 3 4 5 = Ability Selection
Left Click = Damage or heal targets that you are hovering over
Space = End round
Escape = Pause

IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Make sure to select 5 abilities OR do not try to use an abilities that you do not have assigned. This instantly crashes the game for some reason

Index:
Ignite = damage at the end of players turn = to rounds of ignite. Extra damage on Frosted targets and wipes both
Drenched = Extra damage on next Frost spell. Would do more but haven't finished it yet.
Frost = Reduces enemy attack my 30%. Extra damage on Ignited targets and wipes both

Known Bugs:
If and Enemy dies to ignite, you will have to press space again to properly spawn the next enemies

Score screen is not finish
Restart INSTANTLY crashes the game for some reason
Have to select abilities again any time you go back to main menu
Settings do not save (Not really a bug but a heads up)


Please report all bugs and feedback back to me :)
